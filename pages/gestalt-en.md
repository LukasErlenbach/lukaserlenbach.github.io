Welcome.

&nbsp;


Gestalt therapy is not about finding quick solutions, but about becoming aware of what is truly present â€“ in your thoughts, in your body, in your feelings.

&nbsp;
Â 

For me, as a mathematician, ultrarunner and AI-consultant, Gestalt has become essential in connecting structure with flow, control with trust, and head with heart, belly and pelvis â€“ allowing me to feel fully alive.

&nbsp;

If you wish for change in your life and are willing to take the effort to get to know yourself more deeply, I will gladly accompany you with honesty and genuine curiosity.

&nbsp;
Â 

I work in dialogue, at eye level, without offering ready-made solutions. Together we will tune in closely and explore what actually stands in the way of you and your needs â€“ in your own time, with humor, and in mindful contact.

&nbsp;
Â 

I am a Gestalt therapist in training at [Irgendwie Anders](https://irgendwie-anders.de/).
