**Welcome.**

&nbsp;

Pressure to perform. Exhaustion. Restlessness. Analysis paralysis.
You know there could be more. But you can't access it.

&nbsp;

My approach to Gestalt work isn't about quick fixes. It is about honestly perceiving what is actually there. In your head, your heart, your gut, and your pelvis.

&nbsp;

As a mathematician, ultrarunner, and management consultant, I know the balancing act between structure and flow. For me, Gestalt is the key to connecting control with trust and reclaiming aliveness.

&nbsp;

I am happy to accompany you if you desire change or feel overwhelmed by options. We work in a dialogue at eye level. Without pre-packaged advice. Together, we explore which patterns are standing in your way and how to access your resources again. At your pace, with humor, and mindful presence.

&nbsp;

*Currently, I am in advanced training as a Gestalt therapist at [Irgendwie Anders](https://irgendwie-anders.de/) and preparing for the state licensure as a Heilpraktiker für Psychotherapie.*

\

*My current offer is strictly limited to **Consulting, Coaching, and Self-Experience** for personal development. I do not offer diagnosis or medical treatment of mental disorders in a clinical sense at this stage.*

&nbsp;

Drop me a line to get to know me:
<a href="mailto:" class="crypted-mail"
   data-name="$email_username$"
   data-domain="$email_domain$"
   data-tld="$email_tld$"
   onclick="window.location.href = 'mailto:' + this.dataset.name + '@' + this.dataset.domain + '.' + this.dataset.tld; return false;">
</a>.
